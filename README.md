## Problem Statement

First-generation university students—those who are the first in their families to attend college—face systemic barriers that lead to high dropout rates, underemployment, and academic stress. While institutions offer resources, navigating them requires a level of institutional knowledge and support that these students often lack.

### Core Challenges

1. **The Guidance Deficit**: Unlike peers with university-educated parents, first-generation learners cannot rely on family networks for academic navigation, course selection, or career coaching.
2. **Asymmetric Opportunity Discovery**: Critical resources like scholarships, internships, and research opportunities are scattered. Students who need financial aid the most are often unaware of deadlines or eligibility requirements.
3. **The Social Capital Gap**: Career success is highly dependent on professional networks. Rural and low-income students start with minimal professional connections and face significant barriers in finding industry mentors.
4. **Financial and Psychological Stress**: The combination of financial pressure, academic adjustment, and isolation leads to high burnout and dropout rates.
5. **Language and Family Alignment Gaps**: Multilingual students and parents from rural backgrounds struggle to understand university milestones, leading to misalignment between family expectations and academic realities.

---

## Vision

Sahaayak AI aims to become the **Student Success Operating System (SSOS)** for universities globally. Our mission is to democratize student guidance, leveling the playing field for first-generation and underrepresented learners by translating complex institutional pathways into a clear, personalized, and actionable roadmap.

By unifying academic profiles, career aspirations, financial aids, and social connections into a single cohesive platform, Sahaayak AI shifts student support from *reactive intervention* to *proactive empowerment*.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```### AI Mentor Companion

The **AI Mentor Companion** provides 24/7 personalized, context-aware mentoring. Rather than serving as a generic chatbot, it operates on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline coupled with the student's live **Digital Twin** context.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Automatically weights queries with the student's current CGPA, active goals, skill gaps, and risk factors.
- **Conversational Memory**: Maintains a multi-turn history backed by a Redis-cached session-manager to guide students through long-term academic decisions without data loss.
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports 8 Indian languages (Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Gujarati, Bengali, English) via a real-time translation loop. Client inputs are converted to English for precise vector retrieval and logic evaluation, and the generated response is then translated back to the target language and streamed to the client.
- **Speech Synthesis (TTS) Locale Alignment**: Translates spoken outputs using client-side Speech Synthesis, dynamically adjusting the voice engine's BCP 47 locale codes (e.g., `mr-IN` for Marathi, `hi-IN` for Hindi) to match the selected language and prevent pronunciation failures.

### Student Digital Twin

The **Student Digital Twin** is a multi-dimensional, dynamic state representation of the student's academic, vocational, and psychological journey. It acts as the central data model that fuels the platform's intelligence.
- **Multi-Dimensional Metrics**: Captures academic performance (CGPA), career alignment, skill acquisition velocity, financial stability index, social engagement metrics, and wellness indicators.
- **Real-Time Synthesis**: Dynamically updates as the student completes coursework, attends mentor sessions, or logs community interactions.
- **Actionable State**: Rather than a static dashboard, it translates metrics into immediate, targeted system triggers (e.g., automatically flagging burnout risk if engagement drops while study hours spike).

### Career GPS & Orbital Graph

The **Career GPS** acts as a dynamic navigation system for career goals. Built on a custom orbital layout engine, it visualizes the complete educational and professional ecosystem surrounding the student.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Uses React Flow to render a solar-system style graph with the student node at the center, orbiting career goals, required skills, matching courses, eligible scholarships, and active mentors.
- **Dynamic Skill Gap Analysis**: Compares the student's current skill profile against the requirements of their dream career, dynamically highlighting priority skill nodes.
- **Orbital Hierarchy Layout**: Distributes first-degree targets in an inner orbit and second-degree dependencies (e.g., recommended courses linked to skills) in an outer orbit, maintaining clear visual relationships.

### Opportunity Copilot

The **Opportunity Copilot** actively matches students with scholarships, internships, jobs, and hackathons, eliminating discovery barriers.
- **Vector-Based Matchmaking**: Embeds opportunities and profiles in a high-dimensional space, ranking options by relevance, eligibility, and urgency.
- **Financial Aid Targeting**: Prioritizes emergency funds and merit-based scholarships for students identified with high financial risk.

### Predictive Intelligence Engine

The **Predictive Intelligence Engine** monitors student progression to forecast long-term outcomes and identify challenges early.
- **Risk Projections**: Calculates probabilities for dropout, academic probation, and wellness burnout.
- **Success Probabilities**: Forecasts job placement likelihood and scholarship acceptance rates based on matching criteria.
- **Explainability Layer**: Provides clear, human-readable explanations for every model prediction, detailing the exact contributing factors and recommending immediate mitigations.

### Social Capital Engine

The **Social Capital Engine** bridges the networking gap by connecting students with industry mentors and peer study groups.
- **Mentor Matching**: Ranks mentors based on industry alignment, shared background (e.g., alumni from the same town), and conversational compatibility.
- **Peer Cohort Formation**: Groups students working on similar career roadmaps to encourage collaborative learning.

### Parent & Real-Time Voice Companion

The **Real-Time AI Voice Companion** (accessible via the floating widget or specialized routes) bridges the gap between the university, student, and their parents by supporting natural, continuous multilingual voice interactions.
- **Persistent WebSocket Audio Streaming**: Streams raw, continuous binary PCM audio packets from the browser microphone to a stateful FastAPI server, which returns synthesized TTS audio stream responses.
- **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**: Utilizes a custom RMS energy thresholding algorithm to analyze audio buffers, segment silence thresholds, and isolate voice boundaries.
- **Real ASR & TTS Inference**: Incorporates automatic Speech-to-Text (using local `faster-whisper` or OpenAI API fallbacks) and Text-to-Speech (using `edge-tts` for regional languages).
- **Emotion & Sentiment Context**: Computes and tracks real-time sentiment scores (Positive, Neutral, Negative) during audio processing, updating the conversation context to provide emotional support.

```

### Frontend Layer
- **Core Stack**: React 19, Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS.
- **State & Routing**: TanStack Router (Vite Start) and TanStack Query (React Query) for state synchronization.
- **Visual Engines**: React Flow for graph layouts, Framer Motion for micro-animations, and Recharts for progress metrics.
- **Why Vite & SSR**: Next-generation Vite tooling combined with TanStack Start enables instant local loading times, while maintaining Server-Side Rendering (SSR) capability for public SEO-optimized landing pages.

### Backend Layer
- **Core Stack**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (Async), Uvicorn.
- **Distributed Tasks**: Celery and Redis handle high-throughput background tasks (e.g., running predictive models, syncing Neo4j, generating voice syntheses).
- **Scheduler**: APScheduler runs daily success index recalculations at midnight.
- **Why Asynchronous**: FastAPI's native async/await model enables handling thousands of concurrent WebSocket connections (for real-time dashboard updates) without blocking system threads.

### AI & Vector Layer
- **LLM Inference**: NVIDIA Qwen-72B Instruct via high-throughput API endpoints.
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB handles unstructured text storage and semantic indexing.
- **Embeddings**: HuggingFace `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` encodes documentation, scholarships, and career paths.
- **RAG Pipeline**: LangChain orchestrates semantic retrieval, document chunking, and prompt synthesis.

### Knowledge Graph Layer
- **Database**: Neo4j Community/Enterprise Edition.
- **Query Language**: Cypher with Map Projections for direct JSON serialization.
- **Why Neo4j**: Relational databases struggle with deep recursive queries (e.g., finding how a course connects to a skill, which targets a career, which matches a mentor). Neo4j executes these path-finding queries in milliseconds, representing the educational ecosystem as it naturally exists—a network.

### Data Layer
- **Database**: PostgreSQL.
- **Async Driver**: `asyncpg` with SQLAlchemy 2.0.
- **Why PostgreSQL**: Provides ACID-compliant transactional persistence for student authentication, onboarding records, success history snapshots, and system configurations.

## Database & Graph Schemas

### PostgreSQL Relational Schema

Sahaayak AI utilizes SQLAlchemy models to enforce data integrity. The core tables include:
1. **users**: Primary user credentials, names, and authentication details.
2. **student_profiles**: Core academic records (college, branch, CGPA) and onboarding status.
3. **career_profiles**: Target career goals and current skill lists.
4. **success_indices**: Dynamic, multi-dimensional success scores.
5. **success_index_histories**: Daily snapshots tracking progress over time.
6. **predictions**: AI-generated risk levels and success probabilities.
7. **forecasting_data**: Future success trajectories (30, 90, 180 days).
8. **interventions**: System-generated alert flags.

### Neo4j Graph Schema

The graph database represents connections between entities in the student success ecosystem:

```
(Student:Student) -[:TARGETS]-> (Career:Career)
(Career:Career) -[:REQUIRES]-> (Skill:Skill)
(Student:Student) -[:HAS_SKILL]-> (Skill:Skill)
(Skill:Skill) -[:LEARN_VIA]-> (Course:Course)
(Student:Student) -[:ELIGIBLE_FOR]-> (Scholarship:Scholarship)
(Student:Student) -[:MATCHES]-> (Opportunity:Opportunity)
(Student:Student) -[:CONNECTED_TO]-> (Mentor:Mentor)
(Student:Student) -[:MEMBER_OF]-> (Community:Community)
(Student:Student) -[:INSPIRED_BY]-> (SuccessStory:SuccessStory)
```

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

### Running Frontend Compilation Check
To verify TypeScript compilation and build success:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

---

## Production Deployment & Scaling

Sahaayak AI is designed to scale horizontally across kubernetes nodes.

### Containerization with Docker

The system provides complete multi-stage `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose` setups.

#### Running the entire stack via Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Scaling Strategies

1. **Stateless FastAPI Gateways**: FastAPI application servers do not maintain local sessions. They can be scaled horizontally behind an NGINX or AWS ALB load balancer.
2. **Celery Worker Scaling**: Background task workers can be scaled independently based on Redis queue length. Compute-heavy tasks (like LLM RAG pipelines) are isolated from transactional API requests.
3. **Neo4j Read Replicas**: For high-read workloads, Neo4j Causal Clustering is utilized. Read queries are routed to read replicas, while write transactions are directed to the leader node.
4. **PostgreSQL Connection Pooling**: Utilize `PgBouncer` to manage high-concurrency database connections, preventing connection exhaustion under heavy API traffic.
